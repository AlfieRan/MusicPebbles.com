# Typescript Next.js Chakra-Ui Template

This is a basic Next.js template that uses typescript and the Chakra-ui library.

# Get Started

To get started, edit some files in the `src` directory.

If you need more help getting started, check out the below sections.

### Pages

To add a new page, create a new file in the `src/pages` directory with a file ending in either ".jsx" or ".tsx".

An example page is shown in the `src/pages/index.tsx` file.

### Components

Creating a new component is a lot like creating a new page, however aslong as you do so not in the `src/pages` directory
but instead in the `src/components` directory you will be able to use the component in your pages, and it will not be
turned into a page by next/react. 

An example component is shown in the `src/components/api.tsx` file.
